   - User management (super admin only)
   - Committee member management

3. **Event Management**
   - CRUD operations for events
   - Category-based filtering
   - Event status management
   - Participant limits and registration tracking

4. **Registration System**
   - Public event registration
   - Admin registration management
   - Payment status tracking
   - Registration statistics

5. **Committee Management**
   - Committee member profiles
   - Contact information management
   - Display order management

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Models
```
User (super_admin, admin, user)
├── Basic info (name, email, password)
├── Role-based permissions
└── Event assignment (for admins)

Event
├── Event details (title, description, prize, etc.)
├── Category and rules
├── Participant management
└── Status tracking

CommitteeMember
├── Profile information
├── Contact details
├── Social media links
└── Display order

EventRegistration
├── Participant information
├── Event linking
├── Payment tracking
└── Status management
```

### API Endpoints Structure
```
/api/auth/*          # Authentication & user management
/api/events/*        # Event operations
/api/committee/*     # Committee member operations
/api/registrations/* # Registration operations
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Admin**: Assigned event management only
- **User**: Public access to events and registration

- `registrationController.js` - Registration operations

### Middleware
- `auth.js` - JWT authentication
- `adminAuth.js` - Role-based authorization

### Models
- Updated existing models to match frontend requirements
- Added new models for committee members and registrations
- Proper validation and relationships

### Routes
- RESTful API design
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Public and protected endpoints

- **Sample Events**: 3 events (Fashion, Dance, Music categories)
- **Committee Members**: 6 committee members with full profiles

### Seeding Command
```bash
npm run seed
```

## 🔗 Frontend Integration Points

### API Endpoints Matching Frontend
1. **Authentication**
   - Login/Register endpoints match frontend auth context
   - JWT token handling for admin dashboard

2. **Events**
   - Public event listing matches main page
   - Admin event management matches admin dashboard
   - Category filtering supports frontend filters

3. **Committee Members**
   - Public committee listing matches contact section
   - Admin management matches admin dashboard

4. **Registrations**
   - Public registration matches registration form
   - Admin management matches registration table

### Data Structure Compatibility
- All API responses match frontend TypeScript interfaces
- Proper error handling and success responses
- Consistent data format across all endpoints

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication Security
- JWT token expiration (7 days)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Protected route middleware

### Data Validation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Proper error handling
- SQL injection prevention (MongoDB)
- XSS protection

### Authorization
- Super admin only for sensitive operations
- Event admin limited to assigned events
- Public access for appropriate endpoints

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Database Design
- Proper indexing for performance
- Efficient queries with population
